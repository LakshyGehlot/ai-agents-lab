# AI Agents Lab

This repository is a space for learning and experimenting with AI agents and micro-projects. It's designed to be a hands-on environment for exploring different AI agent architectures, frameworks, and applications.

## Getting Started

1.  **Clone the repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone <repository-url>
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies:**

    Each micro-project might have its own dependencies. Refer to the project's specific README for instructions.

3.  **Set up environment variables:**

    Create a `.env` file in the root directory and add the necessary API keys and other environment variables. You can use the `.env.example` file as a template.

    ```bash
    cp .env.example .env
    ```

    Then, edit the `.env` file with your actual credentials.
